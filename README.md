# Software Development Skills: Front-End

Course work for LUT University's course "Software Development Skills: Front-End" by Viivi Aholainen.

The course work is in two parts: project based on the tutorial series and my own project. They are linked to this repository as submodules. In this repository you can also find the learning diary as a pdf, links to videos of running websites and to deployed github pages and instructions to run the projects.
